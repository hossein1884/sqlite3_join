# Learning Join In Sqlite3
This database includes students and courses and the table n n between the two. We want to learn why we use joins in sqlite3 and what it outputs.





## We use **JOIN** because:

1. We see related data from different tables together - like connecting a customer's name with their orders

2. We avoid data duplication - instead of storing repeated information in every table, we keep data separate and JOIN when needed

3. We optimize memory and storage space - we don't have duplicate data

4. We maintain data integrity - if customer information changes, we only update it in one table

5. We understand relationships between entities more easily - for example, we clearly see the relationship between product, order, and customer

6. We write more efficient and cleaner queries - instead of multiple separate queries, we have one query with JOIN
